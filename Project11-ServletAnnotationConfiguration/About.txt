In THis project we are going to understand the Annotation based configuration

so there are two ways to configure our servlets :
	1. xml based
	2. Annotations based
	
	so there is no need to write lengthy code in xml file for configuration
	
	Annotations made our work easier..
	
	when we want to configure our servlet, just add @WebServlet() annotation..
	
	it takes an "url" as a parameter..
