This is simple web application.. 
In this application, I've gave information about the doGet() method

Basically, in Servlet we have 5 methods
			Get
			Post
			Put
			Delete
			Options
			
So, in this application, I've shown you doGet() method implementation

doGet() is used to get the data.. 
If we use get method, in query string, data will be shows in key-pair format..
