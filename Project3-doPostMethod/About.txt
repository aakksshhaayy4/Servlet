This is simple web application.. 
In this application, I've gave information about the doPost() method

Basically, in Servlet we have 5 methods
			Get
			Post
			Put
			Delete
			Options
			
So, in this application, I've shown you doPost() method implementation

doPost() is used to get the data.. 
If we use post method, in query string, data will not be shows..

when we want to pass username or password or any sensesional data, 
that time we can use post method..
because it maintains the security..
