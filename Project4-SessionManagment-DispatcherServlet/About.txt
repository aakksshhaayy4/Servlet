So, in this project I'm going to call one servlet to another servlet.. 

There are two options to perform this things.. 
		1. RequestDispatcher
		2. Redirect

In this perticular example, we are going to see with Request Dispatcher..

in it we are passing url of the class which we want to call.. 
when we run our program.. that time first of all, 
it will call AddServlet and from that we have write logic for dispatching the class..
because, everything we have configured in web.xml file..
