In this program we are implimenting sendRedirect concept.. 

so, when we run our program, that time first of all it calls addServlet class and in
addServlet class we are defining sendRedirect() method and passing url of the square
class to getting called..

but that time it is not calling it.. bacause.. there is no parameters to process furthure..

there are two posibilities are there.. 
	first of all sendRedirect("url").. and then in next class calling getParameter().. 
	
or else passing the value along with url in send redirect method
	sendRedirect("url?val="+val);
