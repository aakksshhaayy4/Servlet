In this project we are going to see the implementations of the sessions.

so HttpSession is the interface
	it is having two methods :
								setAttribute()
								getAttribute()
								
								
	HttpSession session = req.getSession();
	HttpSession session = req.setSession();
	
	
	it holds the data through session.. and can access/use it to another servlet
