In this project we are going to see the implementation of the cookies

Cookie is a class
	
	by using cookie we can send data to another page
	
first of all, need to add Cookies by using addCookie() method 

then in respective(target) class.. need to get all those cookies using enhanced for loop

but when you get cookie.. that time you'll be having getCookies().. because you also 
dont know how much data is there to get..
