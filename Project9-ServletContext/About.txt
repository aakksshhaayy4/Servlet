So, in this project we are going to understand and implement the servletContext object

what is servletContext ?
	servletContext is an interface..
	servletContext is a object and it is used for to use/take/parcel the same value 
	in the different servlets..
	there is only one servletContext object per web application
	
	we can achieve this servletcontext by defining servletContext object in
	project and then need to configure it in web.xml file also.. 
	
	<context-param> tag we need to use in web.xml while configuration..
	and configuration will be in key-value pair format..
